Preface

The DOTS Programming Language was created to make programming easier to learn, understand, and apply. It helps learners and developers improve their logic, syntax fluency, and overall programming skill through simple, intuitive commands and readable structure.


---

Overview of DOTS

DOTS is an interpreted language inspired by Python’s readability and expressiveness.
It focuses on simplicity, direct syntax, and clarity.

Each statement ends with a double dot (..) to mark completion, and blocks of code are separated by triple dots (...).


---

Core Design Philosophy

Simplicity: Code should read like clear English.

Clarity: The structure of logic must be visible and obvious.

Consistency: Keywords and indentation behave predictably.

Extendibility: DOTS can be used for scripts, AI projects, or embedded apps.



---

Basic Syntax and Structure

Every DOTS program follows this format:

set variable_name = value ..
...
printout("Text or {variable_name}") ..

set is used to declare variables.
printout displays text and variables.
Curly braces {} are used to inject variables into strings.


---

Variables and Data Types

DOTS supports four fundamental data types:

Type	Description	Example

int	Whole numbers	set age = 25 ..
float	Decimal numbers	set price = 49.99 ..
word	Text/strings	set name = "John" ..
bool	True or False values	set isReady = true ..



---

Input and Output

inputs("Enter your name: ") ..
set name = last_input ..
...
printout("Welcome, {name}") ..

inputs() collects user input.
The most recent input is stored in last_input.


---

Conditional Statements

set x = 5 ..
if x > 5 ..
    printout("x is greater than 5") ..
else if x == 5 ..
    printout("x equals {x}") ..
else ..
    printout("x is less than 5") ..
...
printout("done") ..


---

Logical Operators

and → both conditions must be true

or → at least one must be true

not → reverses the condition


Example:

set a = true ..
set b = false ..
if a and not b ..
    printout("Condition met") ..
...
printout("End") ..


---

Loops

For Loop

for loop i = 1 to 5 ..
    printout("Iteration {i}") ..
...
printout("Loop done") ..

While Loop

set count = 0 ..
while loop count < 3 ..
    printout("Count is {count}") ..
    set count = count + 1 ..
...
printout("Finished") ..


---

Comments

// This is a comment
set x = 5 ..  // Inline comment


---

Sample Programs

Program 1: Simple Addition

set x = 5 ..
set y = 3 ..
...
printout("{x} + {y} = {x + y}") ..

Output:

5 + 3 = 8


---

Program 2: Greeting App

inputs("Enter your name: ") ..
set name = last_input ..
...
printout("Hello, {name}! Welcome to DOTS!") ..

Output:

Enter your name: John
Hello, John! Welcome to DOTS!


---

Program 3: Even or Odd Checker

inputs("Enter a number: ") ..
set num = last_input ..
if num % 2 == 0 ..
    printout("{num} is even") ..
else ..
    printout("{num} is odd") ..
...
printout("Done") ..

Output:

Enter a number: 7
7 is odd
Done

Would you like me to now compile this full text into the official PDF Part 1 (with headers, page numbers, and black-on-white formatting)?
Once you confirm, I’ll generate the PDF file and give you a download link.Alright ✅

Before I start rendering the professional formatted PDF for Part 1 of the DOTS Programming Language v1.0, here’s what will happen so you know what to expect:

1. I’ll generate a text-based version first — this ensures we can check the full content and formatting before finalizing.


2. Once you confirm it looks correct, I’ll render it as the downloadable PDF with page numbers and clean black-on-white style.



So let’s build the text version of Part 1 now.
